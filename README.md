Performing Sentiment Analysis on reviews scrapped from Coursera.â€‹

In this project I have retrieved reviews from each course, and then  
cleaned the data using Natural Language Processing.Then I performed sentiment analysis to determine whether the 
review is positive, neutral, or negative, and then I determined which courses are most popular and have the most 
positive or negative reviews.
